### Step to program (Make you you can compile the program before proceeding to next step:
1. Create class with name (with public static void main)
2. Add some class attributes (private)
3. Provides the getter and setter for attributes
4. Constructors with different input parameters
5. main: new instance for the class, call setter and getter to prove the method can function correctly
### The first 5 steps are very basic for a beignner, please pay efforts to practice before moving to step 6.
6. Static Field
7. Static method
### Interface
8. Create a new Interface with only one method and let the class to implement it
9. Initialize a class object to call the interface method
### Optional - Factory Pattern
1.  Create another class to implements Starter. Create Factory Class, with static method to return child class object based on the input parameter
### Interface
11.  One interface for the class to implement
